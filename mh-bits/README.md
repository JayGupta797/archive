Mental health legislation has the potential to address unmet needs through policies centered on increasing access to care and strengthening community-based support structures. However, there is no consensus on the scope of congressional mental health legislation nor process to determine if they are aligned with system needs. MH-BiTS (Mental Health Bill Tracking System) is an interactive tool for exploring and visualizing the topical, temporal, and geospatial breakdown of mental health bills over the past decade. Data was taken from LegiScan, an impartial legislative data web-service.
